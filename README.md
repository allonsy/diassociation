Diassociation
=============

Author: allonsy
email: linuxbash8@gmail.com

This is a disassociation algorithm for a given text source. The result is a grammatically correct yet probably non-sensical scrambling of the words of the given text.

Dependencies:
Python 3.4 main libraries


To run: just run dp.py either by chmodding and running
./dp.py

or using the python utility like so:

python3 dp.py

If no arguments are given, then the program draws from standard input. 

There is an optional argument of an input file that specifies the source text.

Any questions or bugs can be directed to allonsy at linuxbash8@gmail.com
